# Deep_Neural_Network_Application
Welcome to the second (required) programming exercise of Course 1, Week 4 of the Deep Learning Specialization - the final assignment in this course! In this notebook you will build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to the very important problem of classifying cat images from non-cat images.  :)
